INTRODUCTION
=============
The purpose of this project is to create a simple application to budget you money into different categories or object you want to buy.

Let's look at a simple exemple
------------------------------------
Let's say you want to buy for whatever reason a new headphone, a pair of shoes you like and the latest phone. each one of them having diferent price (let's say, 45€, 60€ and 600€ respectively). 

Now if you are rich enough you could buy them instantly but if that's not your case then this small app can help you.
Now let's say you wanna invest 100€ every month into these items until you have earned enough to buy them. 

Well this app can do that for you instantly for you. you'll just have to enter the folowing information and everything will computed. of course everything can be tuned for exemple investing a bit more in the phone by making it in your top priorities.

This app is suppose to let you free about three things when budgeting:
* the rank or priority of the item you want to budget
* A budgeting function (linear,exponantial,logaritmic,polynomial)
* A parameter fot the function

maybe the last two don't seems intuitive at what they are doing but I suggest you to play a bit with the app.

For budgeting we actualy need a function about how the fund will be distributed over the items you want to budget. the linear function will decrease the fund allocated to each items linearly (providing a parameter to tweak the slop on how much it decrease). while exponential function will have a tendancy of promoting a lot items with a good rank and often add 0€ to those behind.

How to use and install
=================
Right now this app is in developement. that mean some bug exist and are yet to be corrected

If you want to use the app as is and compile it for personal use you'll need to install __godot__ and to compile the game withe it or simply use the app with godot.
